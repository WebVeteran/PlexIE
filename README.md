# PlexIE - Plex Image Exporter

PlexIE is an AppleScript application that exports Plex's images (Artwork, Posters, Chapters) into a single folder.
The concentration is on large landscape format images. Portrait images and small images are pruned.

## Usage

Place the enclosed _PlexIE.app into a folder you'd like to store the exported images. Then run it. It takes while, be patient.

### Recommendations

- Make an alias of the app someplace more convenient.
- Set your Desktop Background to use this folder. Change picture: Every 5 minutes. [√] Random order.
- Set your Screesaver to Ken Burns using this folder as the source. [√] Shuffle slide order.
- Add this folder to Time Machine's exclude list.
- Run this app after you've added more movies to Plex.
